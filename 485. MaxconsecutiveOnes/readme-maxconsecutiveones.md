# Find Maximum Consecutive Ones

### Approach

This solution is designed to efficiently find the longest sequence of consecutive `1`s in a binary array. The approach involves iterating through each element of the array and counting consecutive `1`s as they appear. Whenever a `0` is encountered, the count of `1`s is compared to the maximum count found so far. If itâ€™s higher, we update our maximum. This way, the longest streak of `1`s is continuously tracked, even if it appears at the end of the array.

### Key Points

- **Single Pass**: We only go through the array once, making the approach efficient.
- **Tracking Maximum**: We update the maximum count of consecutive `1`s whenever a `0` breaks the current streak.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

This method ensures that we find the longest sequence of `1`s with minimal computation.
